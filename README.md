### 👋 Hi, I'm Ivan

I'm a hands-on investor and former VP/CTO with a passion for building structured systems from messy, domain-specific data. I'm currently a founder and partner at [ScOp VC](https://www.scopvc.com), where I support founders in scaling teams and building vertical AI products.

### 🚀 What I’ve Done

- 🧠 Built one of the world’s largest general-purpose knowledge graphs at [Graphiq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphiq), powering Alexa’s open-domain Q&A system.
- 🤖 Scaled a 140-person team at Amazon across engineering, product, and knowledge ops.
- 🛠️ Invented “knowledge engineering” as an organizational function for domain-based NLU and NLG tooling.
- 🧪 Now exploring how LLMs and structured data can intersect in verticalized, high-signal environments.

### 📚 Interests

- Agentic workflows & reasoning over structured data  
- Using AI to make complex systems legible and navigable  

### 🧬 Fun Fact

I once dropped out of a Financial Math PhD after a professor insisted that “infinite probability” was just something I had to accept. That moment convinced me I was an engineer at heart, not a theorist.
